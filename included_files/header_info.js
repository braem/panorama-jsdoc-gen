/**** Panorama JS Types ****/
// This file is meant to provide JS typing information for Panorama Panels and APIs. It is by no means usable as actual code.
// Having the file open in VS Code will automatically pull in the types all other open JS files.
// If VS Code (or your editor of choice) does not automatically pick up the types, you can `require` it in JS files for development, but that will error in game.
//
// For typing information for specific panel types, you can use JSDoc on fetching panels via `$()`
// Eg:
//// /** @type {ProgressBar} @static */
//// progressBarPanel = $('#ProgressBarPanelID');
//
